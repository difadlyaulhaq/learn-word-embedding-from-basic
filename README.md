## 1. What are Word Embeddings?

Word embeddings are a type of word representation that allows words with similar meanings to have similar representations. They are dense vectors of real numbers that capture the semantic relationships between words. For example, the vector difference between "king" and "queen" is similar to the difference between "man" and "woman."

### Example:
- `vector("cat") - vector("kitten")` is similar to `vector("dog") - vector("puppy")`.

## 2. Different Types of Word Embedding

### 2.1 Frequency-based Embedding

#### 2.1.1 Count Vectors
Count vectors represent words based on their frequency in a document. Each document is represented as a vector of word counts.

#### 2.1.2 TF-IDF
TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) is a statistical measure used to evaluate the importance of a word in a document. It balances the frequency of a word in a document with its rarity across all documents.

#### 2.1.3 Co-Occurrence Matrix
A co-occurrence matrix captures how often words appear together in a given context. This matrix can be factorized using techniques like PCA or SVD to produce word embeddings.

### 2.2 Prediction-based Embedding

#### 2.2.1 CBOW (Continuous Bag of Words)
CBOW predicts a target word based on its context. It is a shallow neural network that learns word embeddings by predicting a word given its surrounding words.

#### 2.2.2 Skip-Gram
Skip-Gram is the inverse of CBOW. It predicts the context words given a target word. This model is particularly effective for learning high-quality word embeddings.

## 3. Using Pre-trained Word Vectors

### 3.1 GloVe
GloVe (Global Vectors for Word Representation) is an unsupervised learning algorithm for obtaining vector representations for words. It combines the advantages of both global matrix factorization and local context window methods.

### 3.2 Sentence Modeling
Sentence modeling involves representing entire sentences as vectors. One approach is to compute the weighted average of word vectors using PCA.

### 3.3 Doc2Vec
Doc2Vec is an extension of Word2Vec that learns embeddings for entire documents. It is useful for tasks like document classification and clustering.

### 3.4 Word2Vec
Word2Vec is a popular model for learning word embeddings. It comes in two flavors: CBOW and Skip-Gram. The notebook provides implementations for both.

## 4. Training Your Own Word Vectors

### 4.1 Word2Vec with Custom Data
You can train your own Word2Vec model using a custom corpus. The notebook provides an example of training a Word2Vec model on a small dataset.

### 4.2 Pretrained Google News Vector Model
The notebook also demonstrates how to use the pretrained Google News Word2Vec model, which contains 300-dimensional vectors for 3 million words and phrases.
